# self host windows minecraft bedrock server

Self updating/downloading so long as the scraper works

You must also run the command `CheckNetIsolation.exe LoopbackExempt –a –p=S-1-15-2-1958404141-86561845-1752920682-3514627264-368642714-62675701-733520436` as admin in cmd

Config for storage found in .env, conda environment in environment.yml

You'll need to try to start once, and then use the download in `/active/current` to change your server.properties. These carry over updates

I'm sure there is lots of missing QOL and outright bugs, but it works for me
